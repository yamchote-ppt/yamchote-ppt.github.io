## üîß Setup Instructions

### Creating the Spreadsheet from Scratch

1. **Create new Google Sheet:**
   - Go to sheets.google.com
   - Click "+ Blank"
   - Rename to "819605 Quiz Submissions"

2. **Create Sheet 1 - QuizData:**
   - Rename "Sheet1" to "QuizData"
   - Add header row with columns A-H as shown above
   - Format column E (Options) as plain text (Format ‚Üí Number ‚Üí Plain text)
   - Add your quiz questions

   - Leave empty (script will auto-create headers)

4. **Create Sheet 3 - Log:**
   - Click "+" to add new sheet
   - Rename to "Log"
   - Leave empty (script will auto-create headers)

### Using the Sample Data Generator

Instead of manually creating data, you can run the `createSampleQuizData()` function in Apps Script:

1. Open Apps Script editor (Extensions ‚Üí Apps Script)
2. Add the Code.gs file
3. Run the function `createSampleQuizData()`
4. Check the QuizData sheet - it will have sample questions

## üìù Data Entry Tips

### Adding Multiple-Choice Questions

1. Write question text in Column C
2. In Column E (Options), enter as JSON array:
   ```
   ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"]
   ```
3. Count which option is correct (starting from 0)
4. Enter the index in Column F

**Example:**
- Options: `["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"]`
- Correct answer is "Orange"
- Enter `2` in CorrectAnswer (0=Apple, 1=Banana, 2=Orange)

### Special Characters in Questions

You can use HTML in question text:
```html
Is {1,2,3} ‚äÜ {1,2,3,4}?
<br><strong>Hint:</strong> Think about subsets!
```

### Mathematical Notation

For mathematical symbols, you can use:
- Unicode: ‚à™ ‚à© ‚äÜ ‚äá ‚àà ‚àÖ ‚Ñï ‚Ñ§ ‚Ñù
- HTML entities: `&cup;` `&cap;` `&sube;`
- LaTeX (if implementing MathJax): `$x^2 + y^2 = z^2$`

## üìä Data Analysis Queries

### Get Average Score by Quiz

```javascript
=AVERAGEIF(Submissions!E:E, "quiz1", Submissions!I:I)
```

### Count Submissions by Grade

```javascript
=COUNTIF(Submissions!J:J, "A")
```

### Find Students Who Haven't Submitted

Use VLOOKUP or QUERY to compare enrollment list with submissions.

### Grade Distribution Chart

1. Select Submissions sheet
2. Insert ‚Üí Chart
3. Chart type: Column chart
4. X-axis: Grade column (J)
5. Count values

## üîí Permissions and Sharing

### For Production Use:

1. **Quiz Data Sheet:**
   - Instructor: Editor
   - TAs: Editor or Viewer
   - Students: No access

2. **Submissions Sheet:**
   - Instructor: Editor
   - TAs: Viewer
   - Students: No access

3. **Apps Script:**
   - Only instructor should have edit access
   - Deploy as "Execute as: Me" and "Who has access: Anyone"

### Privacy Considerations:

- Submissions sheet contains student grades - keep private
- Never share the spreadsheet URL publicly
- Use Apps Script for data access only
- Consider encrypting sensitive data

---

## üì¶ Backup and Export

### Manual Backup

1. File ‚Üí Download ‚Üí Microsoft Excel (.xlsx)
2. Save with timestamp: `quiz-submissions-2025-10-16.xlsx`

### Automated Backup (Apps Script)

Add this function to create daily backups:

```javascript
function createDailyBackup() {
  var ss = SpreadsheetApp.openById(CONFIG.SPREADSHEET_ID);
  var destFolder = DriveApp.getFolderById('YOUR_BACKUP_FOLDER_ID');
  var date = Utilities.formatDate(new Date(), 'GMT+7', 'yyyy-MM-dd');
  ss.copy('Quiz Submissions Backup ' + date).moveTo(destFolder);
}
```

Set up a time-driven trigger to run this daily.
